# Every Way to Get Apple Health Data into an AI in 2026 — Compared

The fundamental problem is simple: Apple has no server-side HealthKit API. Your health data lives on your device. There is no endpoint you can call to fetch someone's step count or HRV trend. Every solution in this space is working around the same constraint, and the approach each one takes determines what you can and can't do.

Here's a direct comparison of the options available today.

## The Core Constraint

HealthKit is on-device only by design. Third-party apps can request permission to read your Health data on your iPhone, but that access is sandboxed to the device. Nothing in Apple's ecosystem provides a way to push HealthKit data to a server without an iOS app with explicit user permission.

This means every approach in this list requires either: (a) an iOS app that reads from HealthKit and sends data somewhere, or (b) a manual export of your Health data XML file. There's no shortcut.

## Approach 1: Native AI Connectors (claude.ai, ChatGPT)

Both Anthropic and OpenAI have shipped integrations that let you connect Apple Health to their web products. Anthropic's launched in early 2026.

**What it does:** Inside the claude.ai web interface, you can connect Apple Health. The AI can then reference your health data when you ask about it in the chat window.

**The gap:** These connectors are web product features. They do not extend to Claude Code, the Claude API, MCP clients, or any automation outside the browser tab. If you run Claude Code in your terminal, build n8n workflows, or call the Anthropic API directly, the native connector is invisible. The bridge doesn't reach.

This is the single most common misunderstanding in this space. A developer who sees the Apple Health option in claude.ai settings reasonably assumes their Claude Code environment has the same access. It doesn't. Claude Code uses the MCP protocol for data access, and the web connector doesn't speak MCP.

**Who this is for:** Non-developers using Claude or ChatGPT through the web interface.

## Approach 2: Health Auto Export

A well-established app ($24.99 lifetime) that has been doing HealthKit data export for years. It recently added an MCP server feature.

**What it does:** Exports HealthKit data in various formats. The MCP server feature runs a TCP server locally and lets Claude Desktop connect to it.

**The constraint:** The MCP server requires the iOS app and the MCP client to be on the same WiFi network. This is a hard architectural limit — the TCP connection is local. If you're SSH'd into a remote machine, running Claude Code on a different network, or using any setup where your Mac and iPhone aren't on the same LAN, the MCP server is unreachable.

Background sync reliability is also a documented issue — iOS aggressively throttles background processes, and polling-based sync will miss data when the phone is idle.

**Who this is for:** Developers who work exclusively on a local machine on the same network as their iPhone, don't need remote access, and prefer a one-time paid app.

## Approach 3: VitalTrends

A subscription app ($5/month) focused on health trend analysis with AI integration.

**What it does:** Syncs HealthKit data and provides AI-powered trend analysis within the app.

**The constraints:** Available via TestFlight only — not on the App Store as of this writing. Closed source. Uses `BGProcessingTask` for background sync, which iOS schedules opportunistically — typically once per day, not on every new sample. If you want data in your AI client at query time (not a day stale), this architecture has a ceiling.

**Who this is for:** Users comfortable with TestFlight beta software who want a polished in-app experience and aren't trying to connect to an external AI client.

## Approach 4: Open Wearables

An open-source project that handles multi-device health data including HealthKit, Oura, and Garmin.

**What it does:** A self-hosted system (Docker) that collects data from multiple wearable sources and provides a unified API. Genuinely useful architecture for anyone with hardware from multiple brands.

**The constraints:** No App Store app — getting the HealthKit component running requires a Discord TestFlight invite and then setting up the Docker stack yourself. For a developer comfortable with self-hosting, this is manageable. For most people, the barrier is real.

**Who this is for:** Developers with multiple wearable devices who are comfortable with Docker and self-hosting, and want a unified data layer across brands.

## Approach 5: Health Bridge (Alex Morris)

A free, open-source tool that syncs HealthKit data directly to a Postgres database.

**What it does:** Handles the iOS → Postgres sync correctly. This is the right architecture — your data in your own database.

**The gap:** No MCP server. No AI integration layer. You get data in Postgres, but you have to build everything on top of that yourself — the MCP server, the query tools, the schema. If you're comfortable doing that, it's a solid foundation. If you want to go from zero to querying your health data in Claude Code without building the tooling, you're missing the second half.

**Who this is for:** Developers who want raw HealthKit → Postgres sync and plan to build their own integration layer on top.

## Approach 6: health4ai

Full-stack: iOS app + MCP server + schema, built as a system.

**What it does:** The iOS app registers `HKObserverQuery` listeners for each metric type — when Apple Watch records new data, HealthKit pushes it to the app, which writes it to your Postgres database. This is push delivery, not polling, which is why sync reflects current data rather than whatever was available during the last background window.

The MCP server provides nine tools covering everything from a daily snapshot (`get_daily_snapshot(date)`) to long-term trend analysis (`get_long_term_trend(metric, months)`) to arbitrary metric queries (`query_metric(metric_type, days)`). It runs on your Mac and connects to any MCP-compatible client — Claude Code, Cursor, Ollama via mcphost.

Full backfill on first launch imports your complete HealthKit history. The database-as-store architecture means queries aren't limited by what the iOS app can return in real time.

**Who this is for:** Developers who want the complete pipeline — sync, persistence, and AI-queryable tools — without assembling the pieces manually.

## Summary Table

| Solution | App Store | Remote Access | MCP Server | Background Sync Method | Database | Price |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| claude.ai connector | — | Web only | No | Apple's pipe | Apple servers | Free (Anthropic account) |
| Health Auto Export | Yes | Same WiFi only | Yes (local TCP) | BGProcessingTask | None (export files) | $24.99 |
| VitalTrends | TestFlight | In-app only | No | BGProcessingTask | Proprietary | $5/mo |
| Open Wearables | No (Discord TF) | Yes (self-hosted) | No | Varies | Self-hosted | Free |
| Health Bridge | No | Yes | No | HKObserverQuery | Your Postgres | Free |
| health4ai | Yes | Yes | Yes | HKObserverQuery | Your Postgres | Free (founding batch) |

## Which Should You Use?

If you use Claude or ChatGPT through the browser and don't need developer-level access: the native connectors are fine.

If you're a developer working in Claude Code, building n8n workflows, or querying the Anthropic API: the native connectors won't reach you. You need an MCP server backed by a database.

If you already self-host everything and have multiple wearables: Open Wearables is worth evaluating.

If you want the iOS → Postgres → MCP pipeline working without assembling it from scratch, health4ai covers the full stack.
