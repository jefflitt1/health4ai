-- 1. Health data — read and delete your own; writes go through the ingest fn
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- READ is granted, unlike legacy 009 which denied all client access. A hosted
-- consumer app has to render the user's own numbers on-device; without this the
-- Today screen has no data source and the product is a write-only pipe.
--
-- DELETE is granted deliberately: a health app must let a person destroy their
-- own data on demand, and routing that through support tickets is not a
-- privacy control. INSERT/UPDATE stay denied — the client never decides what
-- user_id a row carries. healthkit-ingest validates the JWT and stamps user_id
-- from it, then writes with the service role, which bypasses RLS.
GRANT SELECT, DELETE ON public.healthkit_metrics         TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT, DELETE ON public.healthkit_daily_summaries TO authenticated;

-- The ingest function writes with the service role, and the grant has to be spelled out here.
-- Supabase stopped auto-granting Data API access (anon / authenticated / service_role) on new
-- `public` tables: new projects first, existing projects from 2026-10-30. Without this line a
-- freshly bootstrapped project answers every sync with 42501 "permission denied for table
-- healthkit_metrics". Exactly what each caller does, and nothing more:
--   * upsert (INSERT .. ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE) in healthkit-ingest: INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT
--     for the conflict check;
--   * health4ai_replace_merged_hours (SECURITY INVOKER, so it runs as this role): DELETE.
-- The daily-summaries and settings tables get no service_role grant: nothing in this repo
-- reaches them through the Data API with that key (compaction runs as the table owner through the
-- Management API SQL endpoint, see scripts/summarize_historical.py). The first caller that needs
-- one adds a GRANT here, in the same change as the caller.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- energy, flights, exercise/move/stand time) the app sends HealthKit's merged total per UTC
-- hour, labelled source_device 'HealthKit (all sources)'. Rows already stored per device for
-- that hour would be summed on top of it: an iPhone and a Watch counting the same steps is
-- how 2021 came to read 67% high. So the hour's per-device rows are deleted and the merged
-- row written in ONE transaction; done as two requests, a failure between them left the hour
-- either double-counted or empty. A per-device row belongs to the hour its started_at falls
-- in, so a sample crossing a boundary is replaced when the hour it started in arrives.
-- Register D361.
-- One DELETE per hour with constant bounds: a single DELETE .. USING jsonb_to_recordset
-- cannot push the hour range into an index (bounds come from the recordset), planned as a
-- full-table scan and hit PostgREST's 8 s statement timeout on any project with real
-- history (measured 2026-09-13, 15 s for a two-hour payload). Still one transaction.
