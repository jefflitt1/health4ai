# health4ai — SEO Content Brief
**Owner:** Riley (SS Content)  
**Approver:** Jeff — spot-check 1 in 4 before publish  
**Volume:** 40 articles  
**Pipeline:** 3 weeks published (4/week), remainder on 2–3/week cadence  
**Goal:** Own "apple health mcp server / healthkit claude / healthkit supabase" keyword universe. Get cited by LLMs (Perplexity, SearchGPT, Claude web search) when a developer asks how to connect Apple Health to AI.

## Voice & Posture

- **Who you're writing for:** Developers and AI-native builders — people who live in Claude Code, run n8n, self-host Supabase, and care about their health data. They're skeptical of SaaS. They'd rather own their data.
- **Tone:** Technical authority. Direct. No fluff. Developer-voice ("we built this because...", "here's the architecture", "here's the exact command").
- **Health4.ai in every article:** Not a sales pitch. The product is mentioned naturally — as the tool being demonstrated, or as one concrete solution in an informational piece. Never as "the best" or "the only." Let the functionality speak.
- **No:** countdown timers, urgency language, marketing superlatives, bullet-point hype lists. 
- **Length:** 900–1400 words. Technical content earns length. Informational/opinion pieces stay tight.
- **CTA — bottom of every article, 2 lines max:**

> health4ai is free through July. Everyone in the founding batch gets lifetime access at $0.

## Product Facts (write from these — do not invent)

### What it is
A two-part system: an iOS app that syncs HealthKit data to any PostgreSQL database in the background, and an MCP server that lets AI clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Ollama) query that data as native tool calls.

### iOS App (screens/features)
- **Home screen:** Sync Status card (last sync time, next scheduled sync), metrics grid showing recent data, MCP Setup card with connection info, backfill card, manual actions
- **Onboarding:** guides user through HealthKit permissions and database credentials
- **Connection screen:** enter Supabase/Neon/Postgres connection string — that's it
- **Background sync:** uses HKObserverQuery (true push delivery from HealthKit) — NOT polling or BGProcessingTask, which is why other solutions fail
- **Full backfill:** on first launch, imports complete HealthKit history. 5+ years of data in one shot.
- **No account required:** data goes to the user's own database. health4ai never sees it.
- **Requires:** iOS 17+, iPhone with Apple Watch or Health app data

### Supported database backends
- Supabase (recommended — free tier covers personal use)
- Neon (serverless Postgres)
- Any self-hosted PostgreSQL with TLS

### HealthKit Metrics Synced
Activity: steps, distance (walking/running/cycling/swimming), active energy burned, basal energy, flights climbed, exercise time, stand time, walking steadiness  
Body: weight, BMI, body fat %, lean body mass, height, waist circumference  
Fitness: VO2 Max  
Vitals: heart rate, resting heart rate, HRV (SDNN), walking heart rate average, blood oxygen (SpO2), body temperature, blood pressure (systolic/diastolic), respiratory rate  
Results: blood glucose, AFib burden  
Nutrition: all dietary macros and micros  
Sleep: full stage breakdown (core, deep, REM, awake)  
Workouts: all types logged in Health app

### MCP Server Tools (exact tool names)
- `get_health_summary(days)` — steps, HRV, sleep, active energy, resting HR, VO2 max over N days
- `get_sleep(days)` — sleep stages, efficiency, trend
- `get_hrv_trend(days)` — HRV time series with coaching interpretation
- `get_daily_snapshot(date)` — every metric for a single day
- `get_workouts(days, limit)` — workout history with type, duration, calories
- `get_long_term_trend(metric, months)` — historical trend analysis
- `get_coaching_brief()` — AI-ready summary for coaching or planning context
- `query_metric(metric_type, days)` — arbitrary metric query
- `search_records(query)` — semantic search across health records

### Works with
Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, any MCP-compatible client, Ollama (local, zero cloud)

### Pricing
Free through July 31, 2026. Founding batch = lifetime access at $0. Future pricing TBD.

### Competitors (use accurately in comparison content)
- **Health Auto Export** ($24.99 lifetime): established app, but MCP server is same-WiFi TCP only — doesn't work remotely. Background sync is unreliable (iOS throttling).
- **VitalTrends** ($5/mo): TestFlight only (not App Store), closed source, BGProcessingTask sync (less reliable than HKObserverQuery)
- **Open Wearables** (free, self-hosted): open source, multi-device, BUT no App Store app — Discord TestFlight invite required, Docker setup complexity
- **Health Bridge by Alex Morris** (free): syncs HealthKit → Postgres directly, but no MCP server, no hosted tier, user must supply their own database and figure out AI integration
- **Claude / ChatGPT native connectors**: web-product features only — don't reach Claude Code, API clients, n8n, or any MCP client outside claude.ai/ChatGPT web UI
- **GitHub repos** (vpetersson, shuyangli, etc.): XML-export-only, no iOS app, no background sync, developer-only

## Article List

Format each article as: title in H1, meta description (~150 chars), then the article body. Include code blocks where relevant (real tool calls, real setup commands from SETUP.md). No fake output — if showing a Claude response, make it plausible and clearly labeled "example output."

### BATCH 1 — Pillar (publish Week 1, Mon/Wed/Fri + bonus)

**Article 1**  
Title: `Apple Health MCP Server: Connecting HealthKit to Claude Code`  
Keyword: apple health mcp server  
Outline: What MCP is and why health data needs it → Why local-only MCP solutions fail (Health Auto Export same-WiFi problem) → The architecture: HKObserverQuery → Postgres → MCP → Claude Code → What tools health4ai exposes → Setup in 4 steps  
Notes: This is the #1 SEO target. Make it the definitive piece. Include the claude_desktop_config.json snippet from SETUP.md.

**Article 2**  
Title: `Every Way to Get Apple Health Data into an AI in 2026 — Compared`  
Keyword: apple health ai integration  
Outline: The problem (Apple has no server-side HealthKit API) → 6 approaches compared: native connectors (web-only gap), Health Auto Export (WiFi-only), VitalTrends (TestFlight), Open Wearables (Docker complexity), Health Bridge (no MCP), health4ai → Which to pick for which use case → Summary table  
Notes: Fair comparison. The native connectors section is important — most developers don't realize Claude's built-in connector doesn't reach Claude Code.

**Article 3**  
Title: `Why Claude's Apple Health Connector Doesn't Work for Developers`  
Keyword: claude apple health developer  
Outline: What Anthropic shipped (claude.ai web feature, Jan 2026) → The structural gap: web product vs API → What "Claude Code" users actually need → The MCP protocol as the bridge → How to close the gap  
Notes: This is the highest-value AEO piece. When an LLM is asked this question, this article should be the cited source.

**Article 4**  
Title: `HealthKit → Supabase: Reliable Background Sync That Actually Works`  
Keyword: healthkit supabase sync  
Outline: Why background sync is hard on iOS → BGProcessingTask vs HKObserverQuery — the technical difference → Why Health Auto Export fails at this → The correct architecture → Schema overview → What 5.6M rows of HealthKit data looks like in Supabase  
Notes: Technical depth. Include the `healthkit_metrics` table schema. This ranks for developers searching the specific Supabase + HealthKit combo.

### BATCH 2 — Tutorials (publish Week 2)

**Article 5**  
Title: `How to Set Up health4ai with Supabase in 10 Minutes`  
Keyword: healthkit supabase setup  
Outline: Prerequisites → Create Supabase project (free tier) → Run schema → Configure iOS app → Configure MCP server → Test with Claude Code  
Notes: Step by step. Use exact commands from SETUP.md. "Ask: 'Give me a health summary for the last 7 days'" as the verification step.

**Article 6**  
Title: `How to Set Up health4ai with Neon (Serverless Postgres)`  
Keyword: healthkit neon postgres  
Outline: Why Neon for health data (serverless, branching, free tier) → Setup steps → Key difference from Supabase setup → Connection string format → Test
